# Project-3-react-game-devLinkedin-frontend
Welcome to the frontend repository for IndieDevHub!

This platform is built using React.js and CSS, and is designed for indie developers to connect with one another and share their skills and projects.

Users can sign up and create a profile listing their skillset, as well as post and browse projects that are searchable by skillset. Users can also post comments on projects.

This repository contains the code for the client-side of the platform. It handles the rendering of the user interface, form submission and validation, and the interactions with the backend API.
